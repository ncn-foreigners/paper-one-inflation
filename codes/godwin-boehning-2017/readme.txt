Estimation of the population size using the one-inflated positive Poisson model
R. T. Godwin and D. Böhning
Appl. Statist., 66 (2017) 425 -- 448


Two files are included as supplementary material. “oippcode.txt” contains R-code for 
reproducing results in the main paper, and “dutch.txt” is the Dutch illegal immigrants data 
including covariates, from van der Heijden et al. (2003a, 2003b).

“oippcode.txt” contains lines of code for entering data for all seven case studies considered in the 
main paper. The R code calculates all population size estimates from Table 5 except the for the 
Poisson mixture model. This is because estimation of the mixture model takes a very long time 
(days depending on data and starting values), the code for the mixture model is very long and 
would clutter the file, and the mixture model performs very poorly as illustrated in the main 
paper. The score test statistic is also calculated.

In the second part of “oippcode.txt”, the Dutch illegal immigrants data with covariates is used. 
The file “dutch.txt” must be in the R working directory.
